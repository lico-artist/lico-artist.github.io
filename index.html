    <h1>Once We Were</h1>

    <div class="poem">
We laughed in halls where echoes stay,  
Shared secrets meant to never stray.  
Your name once lit my phone so bright,  
Now silence greets me every night.

We built our world on jokes and dreams,  
On late-night talks and reckless schemes.  
But time crept in, and hearts grew cold,  
And stories left unsaid grew old.

You’re not the face I used to know,  
Your words feel distant, soft, and slow.  
We pass like shadows, eyes averted—  
Two souls once close, now disconcerted.

Was it pride, or time, or fate,  
That turned our bond to empty slate?  
No fights, no flames, just quiet change,  
A friendship lost, now out of range.

Still, sometimes when the sky turns grey,  
I think of you and yesterday.  
And wonder if you feel it too—  
That once, a stranger looked like you.
